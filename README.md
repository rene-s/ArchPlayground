# ArchPlayground

## Purpose of this script collection

This script collection's purpose is to highly automate the installation and setup of a default Schmidt DevOps workstation. It is not intended for public use and is not easily customisable.

The collection is publicly available for review and inspiration though. If you find errors or have suggestions I would appreciate a note: https://sdo.sh/DevOps/#contact

After running the scripts, the workstation should look like this:

1. All non-volatile memory wiped
1. Set up LVM on LUKS in order to encrypt most parts of the system and still have flexibility of LVM.
1. Set up default users
1. Set up zsh environment
1. Set up GNOME3 desktop environment
1. Set up Java/Android/PHP/web development environment
1. Set up Seafile and office environment

Bear in mind though there is no proper way of customisation as the default Schmidt DevOps workstation specified by the company, not by individual employees. Please direct your suggestions to the management.

## Usage

### Preparations

1. Download the Arch Linux ISO image from https://www.archlinux.org/download/
1. Create a VM in VirtualBox or whatever you are using.
1. Boot from the ISO image.

### First stage

After booting the Arch Linux ISO image, run

```
cd /root
wget "sdo.sh/l/?arch_inst" -O - | tar xz # NOTE: there are no numbers in the URL
```

Then cd into the newly created directory and run

```
sh ./system/01_pre_disk_setup.sh # NOTE: at this point, the keymap will be german
sh ./system/02_pre_base_install.sh
```

After that, reboot and remove the Arch ISO image from the VM.

### Second stage

Log in as root, then:

```
systemctl start dhcpcd.service
su - <your_username>
cd /usr/local/share/tmp/ArchPlayground
sh ./system/03_post_base_install.sh
exit
sh ./system/04_post_desktop_default_install.sh
reboot
```

### Third stage

Log in as user and open a terminal. Then finish the installation:

```
cd /usr/local/share/tmp/ArchPlayground
sh ./system/05_post_desktop_default_setup.sh
```

Log out, repeat for all other users that require setup.

### Optional stage

Once the default system has been set up you may want to run one or more of these scripts:

| Name | Purpose
| ---- | -------
| ```user/setup_latex.sh``` | Sets up a LaTeX environment with "TeX Live", Koma-Script, and Kile 
| ```user/setup_luks_disk.sh``` | Encrypts and sets up a second permanent hard disk or solid state disk
| ```user/setup_programming.sh``` | Installs the default SDO software development environment for Java, PHP, and JavaScript/NodeJS

## Virtualbox and UEFI booting

In the VM settings, go to ```System > Mainboard``` and enable ```EFI```. The virtual drive must be connected to a SATA controller.

Instead of showing the boot loader right away you may get thrown to a UEFI console. Switch to FS0 by typing ```FS0:```. Then start the boot loader by running ```EFI\arch_grub\grubx64.efi``` (on german keyboards backslash is the # key).

## Todo

1. Card reader does not work: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=164210
1. Hibernation has not been set up.
1. ~~Special keys for screen brightness and touchpad do not work yet.~~
1. ~~```xrandr --listproviders``` returns 0 providers. Investigate why and determine whether the Nvidia GPU is being employed or not: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/hybrid_graphics and https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PRIME and https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee -- ```optirun glxspheres64``` lÃ¤uft nur das erste Mal schnell.~~

# Howtos

## Convert a P640RF system (Tuxedo notebook) for an Intel NUC8i7BEH

Keys at startup:

- `F2` for entering the "Visual BIOS" (from now on references as "BIOS").
- `F10` for selecting the boot device.

1. In the BIOS disable "Devices > USB > USB Legacy".
1. In the BIOS enable "Boot > Boot Priority > Legacy Boot".
1. In the BIOS enable "Boot > Boot Configuration > UEFI Boot > Internal UEFI Shell".
1. In the BIOS disable "Boot > Boot Configuration > UEFI Boot > Network Boot".
1. (Path is missing) In the BIOS set Thunderbolt security to "Unique ID".
1. In the BIOS under "Devices > Video" set "auto" as primary video port.
1. Then boot an Arch image from a USB drive and mount the system:
   ```bash
    cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/nvme0n1p2 lvmdisk # enter the passphrase.
    mount /dev/mapper/SDOVG-rootlv /mnt/
    mount /dev/mapper/SDOVG-homelv /mnt/home/
    mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/
    arch_chroot /mnt
   ```
1. Disable this network device: `systemctl disable dhcpcd@enp3s0f1.service`.
1. Remove the P640RF-specific kernel options from `/etc/default/grub`.
1. Remove the P640RF-specific modules from `/etc/modules-load.d/sdo-modules.conf`.
1. Remove the following Arch packages: `bumblebee primus`.
1. Add the following Arch packages: `bolt`.
1. Run this: 
   ```
   exit # from chroot
   mkdir /mnt/hostrun
   mount --bind /run /mnt/hostrun
   arch-chroot /mnt
   mkdir /run/lvm
   mount --bind /hostrun/lvm /run/lvm
   grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   ```
1. Create `/boot/startup.nsh` with this content: `\EFI\arch_grub\grubx64.efi`. 
1. Make sure that time and date are correct!

Reboot. The system should now boot without interaction required.
